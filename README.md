# Interaction Checklist

This is a GUI app that is meant to make checking interactions of several pairs of things easier.

# Building/Running

1. If you haven't already, [install Rust/Cargo](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Try running `cargo run`. If that starts up the placeholder/demo, you're set.
3. If you got an error, refer to the instructions for [raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs#installation). Some libraries/utilities may need ot be installed. Eventually `cargo run` should work. That said as of this writing, I have only tested on Windows and Linux.
